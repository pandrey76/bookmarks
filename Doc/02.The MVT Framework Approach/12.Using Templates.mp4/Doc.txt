    Why Templates?
      * Remember our third view?
        class SimpleHelloPersonVersion2(View):
             """
               View that return Hello $person parameter
             """
             def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                 return HttpResponse('<h1>Hello {}</h1>'.format(kwargs['name']))

    What's Wrong?
      * Our HTML is hardcoded directly in View;
      * We combine presentation with data handling logic;
      * We are combining the VC of MVC when these concerns should be separate;
      * Our python developers have to also understand HTML;
      * The HTML response is insufficient;
      * It does not provide a full HTML document including HTML version, <head>, <body> tags.

    Introducing TemplateView
      * Django provides us a View that preconfigured to render a HttpResponse from a template;
      * Note that we do not need to provide a get() method
          class TemplateHelloPerson(TemplateView):
              """
                  View that uses template to return Hello $person parameter
              """
              template_name = 'locations/hello.html'
              def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
                  context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
                  context['name'] = self.kwargs['name']
                  return context

    Defining Our Base Template
      * The overall structure of a HTML document is not going to change for each request;
      * We can have a base template provide this skeleton structure, and our individual templates can then
                                                                                                  flesh out the detail;

    Defining Our View Template
      * Our view template can focus on two aspects of the response, the document title and the content;
      * Both the title and the content need to make use of the 'name' parameter;
      * Note that we could have called it something else other than 'name':
         context['xyz'] = self.kwargs['name'] would mean we use 'xyz' in our template.

        Accessing Our Forth  View:

         http://127.0.0.1:8000/locations/hello4/Fred/

          And we see  in our browser "Hello Fred" in green background.

            or

         http://127.0.0.1:8000/locations/hello4/Alice/

          And we see  in our browser "Hello Alice" in green background.
