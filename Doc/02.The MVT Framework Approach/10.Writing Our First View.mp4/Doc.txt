    Class Based Views
      - Django provides a base class: View;
      - A subclass of View that provides a method such as get() can used as a Django View;
      - Request data is provided in the request parameter, *arg and **kwarg contain parameters configured in the url;
      - The handler method should return a HttpResponse.

    Our First View
      * View;
      * HttpResponse.

       Example:
          class SimpleHelloWord(View):
              """
                  View that returns Hello World
              """

              def get (self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                  return HttpResponse('<h1>Hello world</h1>')

                       SimpleHelloWord.as_view(),
