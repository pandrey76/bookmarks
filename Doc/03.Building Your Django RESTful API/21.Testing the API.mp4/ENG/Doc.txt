       Summary

        * APIs are optimized for computer to computer communication. REST is an API using HTTP;
        * Built a simple Hello World API using section 2 implementation strategies:
            - The Django REST framework provides us an extensive toolkit to develop our APIs;
            - Serializers, ModelSerializers, HyperlinkModelSerializers, APIView, generic views, and viewsets;
            - Routers.
        * Tested our API, both at an integration level and at a method level.
